# w3OS

## Summary

w3OS is an operating system simulation developed as a university project. It incorporates essential operating system functionalities, such as reading and writing to the disk, implementing scheduling algorithms using data structures like priority queues and ArrayLists, and efficiently handling concurrent jobs through the use of clean and optimized code solutions.

The project serves as an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in operating systems coursework and demonstrates a solid understanding of core operating system principles.
